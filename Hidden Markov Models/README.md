# Hidden Markov Models

## Tasks:

1. Build a hidden Markov model
2. Simulate the HMM for 100 time steps
3. Discard the hidden states from the sample obtained above. Use the remaining observations to compute the filtered and smoothed probability distributions for each of the 100 time points. Compute also the most probable path.
4. Compute the accuracy of the filtered and smoothed probability distributions, and of the most probable path.
5. Repeat the previous task with different simulated samples.
6. Does more observations result in better knowledge of where the robot is?
7. Consider any of the samples above of length 100. Compute the probabilities of the hidden states for the time step 101.
