# State Space Models

Implement the particle filter for robot localization. The robot moves along the horizontal axis according to the SSM given in "SMModel.pdf"




## Tasks

1. Implement the SSM above. Simulate it for 100 time steps 
2. Repeat the task above replacing the standard deviation of the emission model with 5 and then with 50
3. show and explain what happens when the weights in the particle filter are always equal to 1, i.e. there is no correction.
